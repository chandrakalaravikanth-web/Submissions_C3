        "## Day 6 Session 2 - Advanced RAG Fundamentals\n",
        "\n",
        "**OBJECTIVE:** Implement advanced RAG techniques including postprocessors, response synthesizers, and structured outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**LEARNING GOALS:**\n",
        "- Understand and implement node postprocessors for filtering and reranking\n",
        "- Learn different response synthesis strategies (TreeSummarize, Refine)\n",
        "- Create structured outputs using Pydantic models\n",
        "- Build advanced retrieval pipelines with multiple processing stages\n",
        "\n",
        "**DATASET:** Use the same data folder as Assignment 1 (`Day_6/session_2/data/`)\n",
        "\n",
        "**PREREQUISITES:** Complete Assignment 1 first\n",
        "\n",
        "**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n",
        "1. Complete each function by replacing the TODO comments with actual implementation\n",
        "2. Run each cell after completing the function to test it\n",
        "3. The answers can be found in the `03_advanced_rag_techniques.ipynb` notebook\n",
        "4. Each technique builds on the previous one\n"
